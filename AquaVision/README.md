## Abstract

### Background & Problem Statement
Morocco is currently experiencing a severe water crisis, marked by a dramatic 70% reduction in rainfall. The challenge extends beyond the scarcity itself - government agencies and decision-makers lack efficient tools and clear information for water resource management, leading to suboptimal water allocation and increased risk of shortages.

### Impact & Proposed Solution
AquaVision serves as an AI-powered companion for government agencies and decision-makers across Morocco and Africa. By combining advanced AI technologies, such as GenAI and LSTM models, with comprehensive data analysis, it transforms complex water management decisions into actionable insights, enabling more informed and efficient water resource allocation.

### Project Outcomes & Deliverables
1. **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualization of Morocco's water situation and latest water-related news
2. **AI Smart Assistant**: Water situation aware assistant for more usable knowledge
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting of critical water parameters (AFW, Water stress level, Water use efficiency)
4. **Data Transparency**: Access to data and knowledge base used by AquaVision

## Features

### 1. Insightful Dashboard
- Latest water-related news in Morocco
- Intuitive graphs displaying various water metrics
- Water situation monitoring

### 2. Smart Water Assistant
- AI-powered assistant helping leaders understand water challenges/situation quickly
- Country-specific detailed reports
- Complex water challenges simplified into actionable insights

### 3. Advanced Forecasting
- 5-year predictions for critical water parameters (Annual Freshwater Withdrawals, Water stress level, Water use efficiency)
- Summarized overview of predictions
- Explaination & Analysis for each water metric's predictions

### 4. Available Data
- Transparent access to data used by AquaVision
- CSV files with water metrics
- PDF knowledge base from international organizations (UNCCD, EDA, etc.)
